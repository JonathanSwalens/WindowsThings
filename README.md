## SDR Content Brightness Tool for HDR Monitors

**Warning:**  
This tool uses an _undocumented API_ and has not been thoroughly tested for major bugs. **Use at your own risk.**

- **Purpose:** Adjusts the brightness of SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) content on HDR (High Dynamic Range) monitors.
- **API:** Utilizes a function from `dwmapi.dll` (ordinal 171) to set SDR content brightness programmatically.
- **Note:** This is the same adjustment available in Windows Settings under `System > Display > HDR > SDR content brightness`.
